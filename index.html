        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>HTML-Tips is a website created by TootLoose, no money was put into the development of this site, it is not under a brand name and it is under no lisencing meaning you have all rights to copy, use free and legally. Throughout this course we go over basic HTML5 and CSS3 and while it is basic, it is still powerful. This website is made from very basic HTML and CSS so you can make things that look like this. But anyway, enough reading. Let's get coding!</p>
